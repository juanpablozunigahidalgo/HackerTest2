Problem Summary

Same as question 1 — this is simply HackerRank’s Sample Input 0 and Sample Input 1 for the same function:

Input "100" → evaluate all expressions

Input "12" → evaluate all expressions

This confirms and tests the same logic.

Example: num = "100"

Expressions:

"100" → 100

"1+00" → 1

"1+0+0" → 1

"10+0" → 10

Sum = 112

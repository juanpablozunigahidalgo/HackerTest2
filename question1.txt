Problem Summary

Given a string num containing only digits (0–9), you must insert '+' signs between some digits (or none) to form all possible valid mathematical expressions.
Two rules:

You may insert '+' between any two digits.

You cannot insert two '+' signs next to each other (this happens naturally since you decide per gap).

Each expression is evaluated normally (integer addition). You must compute:

The sum of all expression results, modulo 10⁹ + 7.

Example

num = "123"
Valid expressions:

"123" → 123

"1+23" → 24

"12+3" → 15

"1+2+3" → 6

Total = 168
